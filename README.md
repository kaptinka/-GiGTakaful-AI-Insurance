## Features
- **Real-time Fraud Detection**: Quickly identify fraudulent claims using advanced algorithms.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Leverage models like XGBoost for predictive analytics.
- **OCR Capabilities**: Extract data from documents automatically.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **Data Management**: Store and manage data efficiently with MongoDB.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Analyze textual data for better insights.

## Technologies Used
This project incorporates a range of technologies:
- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost for predictive modeling.
- **OCR**: Optical character recognition for document processing.
- **NLP**: Natural Language Processing for analyzing text data.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building web applications.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Monitor and analyze data as it comes in.

## Installation
To set up the GiGTakaful AI system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaptinka/-GiGTakaful-AI-Insurance.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd -GiGTakaful-AI-Insurance
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Use pip to install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up MongoDB**:
   Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running. Create a database for the project.

5. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the following command to start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, navigate to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser. Here, you can upload insurance documents, view analytics, and receive insights about potential fraud.

### Document Upload
- Drag and drop files or use the upload button to submit insurance claims.
- The system will process the documents and display relevant information.

### Analytics Dashboard
- View real-time analytics related to submitted claims.
- Utilize charts and graphs to interpret data effectively.

## How It Works
The GiGTakaful AI system employs several components to achieve its goals:

1. **Data Input**: Users upload documents related to insurance claims.
2. **OCR Processing**: The system extracts text and data from the documents using OCR.
3. **Data Storage**: Extracted data is stored in MongoDB for further analysis.
4. **Machine Learning Analysis**: The system applies ML models to assess the likelihood of fraud.
5. **Results Display**: Users receive feedback through the Streamlit interface.
